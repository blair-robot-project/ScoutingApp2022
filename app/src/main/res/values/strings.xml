  <string name="help_global">Welcome to the 449 Blair Robot Project Scouting/Refereeing App!\n\nFor each match, you will be assigned a team to scout. Watch this robot closely throughout the match, and record what they do.\nOn each page, fill out the fields, and then move on by swiping or with the navigation buttons at the bottom.\n\nWhen you are done, hit the submit button.\nIf you realise you entered something wrong after submitting, you can edit it. Hit the edit icon at the top of the screen and select the match you want to edit. Any data you entered for the next match will be preserved for when you finish editing.\n\nOn many questions you will see a ? icon. Click this to get more information about that field\nIf you need more help with something, don\'t hesitate to ask a scouting leader.</string>

There are parts of their robot that are clearly broken.\n\nSOMETIMES DEAD: dead for a significant portion of the match (around 35â€“70%).\n\nDEAD: the robot is just sitting on the field unable to move.</string>
  <string name="help_defense">Did the robot play any defense?\n\nThis refers to the robot attempting to stop the opposing alliance from scoring, or slow them down, even if it was ineffective.\n\nNONE: the robot never played defense\n\nPART: the robot played defense for part of the match, but also spend some time not trying to block the opponent (though not necessarily scoring points).\n\nALL: the robot played defense for all or nearly all of the Teleop period (not necessarily Auto or Endgame)</string>
